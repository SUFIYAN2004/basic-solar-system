Solar System Simulation

This project is a simple solar system simulation created using Python's turtle module. It visually represents the Sun and the eight planets, along with their respective orbits, in a graphical window.

Features

Uses turtle graphics for visualization

Displays planets with different colors and names

Adds orbital paths for planets

Shows a closing message at the end

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The project uses the turtle module, which comes pre-installed with Python.

How to Run

Download the script or copy the code into a Python file (e.g., solar_system.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the script's directory and run:

python solar_system.py

A graphical window will appear displaying the solar system.

Code Explanation

The round_do function draws circular orbits.

The solar function draws planets with specified colors, sizes, and positions.

The Sun and planets are drawn sequentially with labels.

The program ends with a "Thanks for watching!" message.

Requirements

Python 3.x

turtle module (pre-installed with Python)

License

This project is open-source and free to use and modify.
